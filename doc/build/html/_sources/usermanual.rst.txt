Options
^^^^^^^

-h, --help    help
-y, --year    set year
-m, --month	  set month
-d, --day	  set day
-D, --date	  set date
-Y, --yesterday   set date to yesterday
-L, --lastmonth   set month to ``last month``

.. note::
   The date given via :option:`-D` is parsed directly into :program:`date`. So simulating the option :option:`-Y` via ``-D yesterday`` is absolutely possible.
