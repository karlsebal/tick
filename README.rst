TIme cloCK
==========

A simple time clock to track working hours. Simultanously a tiny exercise in documenting and coding.

Overview
--------

A simple tracker. Since the original just used simple shell scripting to create some self specified output
the controller still relies on bash (there are bashisms). Parsing is accomplished via python. There is output in
pure text and excell, both.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is at [ReadTheDocs](https://timeclock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
